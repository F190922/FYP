It must build a clear stance on terrorism, and extremism. The subject must not be an exclusive domain of the security agencies,” the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, an Islamabad-based policy research and advocacy think tank, said in a report released on Saturday.', '', '', 'The ‘Pakistan Security Report 2022’ noted the TTP, believed to be operating from the neighbouring Afghanistan, remained one of the major actors of violence in Pakistan in the year 2022, with the number of terrorist attacks in the country marking an increase of 27 per cent from the previous year.', 'The number of terrorist attacks in the country also continued to rise for a second consecutive year. A total of 262 terrorist attacks in Pak\xadistan in the year — including 14 suicide bombings — claimed in all 419 lives and injured another 734 people.', 'The security report noted that the Afghan Taliban’s taking power in Kabul, and the Pakistani state’s persistent ambition to engage in peace talks with the TTP had encouraged the group to regroup and escalate terrorist violence in the country.', 'It appears uncertain whe\xadther “the Taliban will fulfil their promises on foreign mi\xad\xadlitant groups such as Al-Qaeda, Islamic State Mo\xad\xadvement of Uzbekistan, ETIM (East Turkestan Islamic Move\xadment) or TIP (Turkistan Islamic Party), and TTP,” the report says, adding that so far, the Afghan Taliban had only acted against IS-K.', 'According to the report, the TTP, local Taliban groups such as Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, IS-K, and other similar religiously inspired groups perpetrated a combined total of 179 terrorist attacks in Pakistan in 2022 as compared to 128 in the previous year, which killed 250 people and injured 262 others.', 'Different Baloch and Sin\xaddhi nationalist insurgent groups carried out 79 attacks, as compared to 77 such atta\xadcks in 2021, which claimed 97 lives and wounded another 259 people.', 'Cross-border attacks', 'As many 15 cross-border attacks took place in Pakistan during 2022. Out of total, 13 attacks happened from across the country’s border with Afghanistan in KP and Balochistan. These attacks from Afghanistan killed 34 people, including 20 security officials, and injured 52 others.', '', '', 'The report underlines that Afghan border forces under the Taliban regime are invo\xadl\xadved in many of such incidents contrary to the past practice when most of the cross-border attacks from Afghanistan were carried out by the TTP or other militant groups.', 'The report recommends that the government should come up with a proper mechanism to implement the National Security Policy as well as the revised NAP. There is a need to increase capacity and role of civilian law enforcement agencies that will prevent the terrorist threat to a significant extent, according to another recommendation.', '“There should be a zero-tolerance policy towards the terrorist groups, and there should be no negotiations with those who are unwilling to quit violence.”', 'The report suggests that a very high vigilance level is required to counter the ma\xad\xadj\xador threat posed by the Baloch and Sindhi nationalist insurgents to foreign engagements and workers in Balochistan and parts of Sindh.', 'Published in Dawn, January 8th, 2023']"
